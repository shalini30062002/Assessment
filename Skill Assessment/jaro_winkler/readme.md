## Jaro-Winkler Algorithm for Name Matching Scores

Welcome to the Jaro-Winkler Algorithm for Name Matching Scores repository! This project implements the Jaro-Winkler algorithm, a string comparison method, to calculate name matching scores between pairs of names. This can be useful in applications such as data deduplication and record linkage.

## Introduction

The Jaro-Winkler algorithm is a well-known method for calculating the similarity between two strings. It is particularly effective for comparing names and detecting similar names with slight differences. This repository provides a basic implementation of the Jaro-Winkler algorithm in [Python](jaro_winkler.py) that can be easily integrated into other projects.

## Features

- Basic implementation of the Jaro-Winkler algorithm.
- Calculate similarity scores (matching scores) between pairs of names.
- Simple and easy-to-understand code that can be customized as needed.

## python installation

## jaro-winkler Algorithm Overview

The Jaro-Winkler algorithm is a string comparison method that takes into account the number of matching characters and transpositions between two strings. The Jaro-Winkler distance is then adjusted by a scaling factor to give more weight to common prefixes. The resulting value is a similarity score between 0 (no similarity) and 1 (complete similarity).
