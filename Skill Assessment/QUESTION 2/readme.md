# Data Preprocessing: Text Cleaning, Tokenization, and Stop Word Removal
## Introduction

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning pipelines. Raw text data often contains irrelevant characters, special symbols, and common words that might not contribute meaningfully to the analysis. This repository provides a simple example of how to preprocess text data to improve its quality and usability for various tasks.

### Prerequisites

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)

## Use the provided Python script to preprocess your text data:
python preprocess_text.py

## Preprocessing Steps
The preprocessing steps include:

Text Cleaning: Removing unnecessary characters, special symbols, and non-alphanumeric characters.

Tokenization: Splitting the text into individual words or tokens.

Stop Word Removal: Removing common words that may not contribute much meaning (e.g., "the," "and," "is").

## Example
Consider the following input text:
"This is an example sentence. It contains some words and punctuation!"

After preprocessing, the text might look like:
"example sentence contains words punctuation"
